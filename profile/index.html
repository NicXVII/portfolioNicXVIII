                I attended primary and middle school regularly, successfully completing exams with an above-average grade. Currently, I am in the final year at the Alessandro Volta Institute in Trieste, specializing in computer science. I made the decision to pursue a career in this field during my second year of middle school, and I have never had any second thoughts about my choice. I am delighted with the path I have chosen.

                As part of my high school curriculum, I am focusing on computer science. I made this decision during my second year of middle school and am currently specializing in this field at the Alessandro Volta Institute in Trieste. Additionally, I plan to continue my education at the University of Trieste, where I will explore the fascinating fields of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I am passionate about these areas and eager to contribute to advancements in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parking Management:</strong> A Java program written using OOP that manages three levels of a parking lot. It tracks available spaces for regular cars, electric cars, and motorcycles. The data is stored and displayed using Excel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Control:</strong> A collaborative project undertaken for the PCTO by a team of 4. It involves the analysis of temperature and air quality data in classrooms using Arduinos. The data is collected from a Mosquitto broker, stored in a SQL database using Python, and visualized on a web page using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Node.js.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appane:</strong> A teamwork project with two participants. I took on the backend development (PHP, SQL) with the goal of creating a website for a bakery based on requirements from the client (the professor). The user-only part was developed collaboratively, while the admin section was solely implemented by me as a personal project. Technologies used include PHP, HTML, SQL, and JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><strong>On Going:</strong> Currently, my mind is buzzing with ideas, and I'm constantly working on new projects. I'm motivated to explore innovative solutions and technologies. Stay tuned for exciting developments!</li>
